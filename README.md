Breast Cancer Classification:-
This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to classify data in the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, apply various classification algorithms, and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective model.

Steps Involved:-
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing 
The breast cancer dataset was loaded using the sklearn library.
Preprocessing Steps:
Handling Missing Values: Missing values, if any, were imputed to ensure a complete dataset.
Feature Scaling: Data was normalized or standardized to bring features to a comparable scale, particularly important for SVM and k-NN.
Justification:
Preprocessing ensures the data is clean, consistent, and ready for training, improving algorithm performance and comparability.

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation
Five classification algorithms were implemented, each with a brief description and explanation of suitability:
(i)Logistic Regression:
A probabilistic linear model effective for binary classification.
Suitable for datasets where features are linearly separable.

(ii)Decision Tree Classifier:
A tree-based model that partitions the data based on feature values.
Useful for capturing non-linear relationships and providing interpretable results.

(iii)Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble technique that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees.
Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy for high-dimensional datasets.

(iv)Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes in high-dimensional spaces.
Effective when data has clear margins between classes.

(v)k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
Classifies a sample based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors.
Simple and intuitive, suitable for datasets with well-defined clusters.

3. Model Comparison 
Performance Evaluation:
Each model was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analysis of Results:
The best-performing model was identified based on evaluation metrics.
The worst-performing model was discussed, with insights into potential reasons (e.g., sensitivity to feature scaling or overfitting).
